The goal of the `agreement` package is to calculate estimates of inter-rater agreement and reliability using generalized formulas that accommodate different designs (e.g., crossed or uncrossed), missing data, and ordered or unordered categories. The package includes generalized functions for all major chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement (i.e., $\alpha$, $\gamma$, $I_r^2$, $\kappa$, $\pi$, and $S$) as well as all major intraclass correlation coefficients (i.e., one-way and two-way models, agreement and consistency types, and single measure and average measure units). Estimates include bootstrap resampling distributions, confidence intervals, and custom tidying and plotting functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmgirard/agreement")
```
## Example

Calculate chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement for unordered categories

```{r example}
library(agreement)
# Load dataset with 4 raters assigning 12 objects to 5 unordered categories
data(unordered)
print(unordered)
```

```{r}
# Calculate all chance-adjusted indexes for unordered categories
results1 <- cat_adjusted(unordered)
summary(results1, ci = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Transform results into a tidy data frame
tidy(results1)
```

```{r, fig.height=3}
# Plot the bootstrap resampling distributions with confidence intervals
plot(results1)
```

Calculate chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement for ordered categories

```{r}
# Load dataset with 5 raters assigning 20 objects to 4 ordered categories
data(ordered)
print(ordered)
```

```{r}
# Calculate all chance-adjusted indexes for ordered categories (linear weights)
results2 <- cat_adjusted(ordered, weighting = "linear")
summary(results2, ci = TRUE)
```

```{r}
tidy(results2)
```

```{r, fig.height=3}
plot(results2)
```

Calculate category-specific agreement

```{r}
# Calculate category-specific agreement
results3 <- cat_specific(ordered)
summary(results3, ci = TRUE)
```

```{r}
tidy(results3)
```

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3, out.width = "50%"}
plot(results3)
```
