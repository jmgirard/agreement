Description: Calculate estimates of inter-rater agreement and reliability using 
    generalized formulas that accommodate different designs, missing data, and 
    ordered or unordered categories. The package includes generalized functions 
    for all major chance-adjusted indexes of categorical agreement (i.e., alpha, 
    gamma, irsq, kappa, pi, and s) as well as all major intraclass correlation 
    coefficients (i.e., one-way and two-way models, agreement and consistency 
    types, and single measure and average measure units). Estimates include 
    bootstrap resampling distributions, confidence intervals, and custom tidying 
    and plotting functions.
